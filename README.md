# record-deps

A Leiningen plugin that lets you include automatically the dependency
tree of your project into the final uberjar.

On every build of the jar or uberjar, this plugin writes the
dependency tree to a file.  By default `resources/deps.txt`.
That implies that the dependency tree will be automatically included
in the jar file as a Java resource.

Later you can check the dependency tree of the jar file as with `lein
deps :tree` but without the project source tree.  You can extract the
dependencies like this

```console
 $ jar xf path-to-your.jar deps.txt
```

or something along the lines.  See below.


## Install

Clone and install locally:

```console
 $ git clone https://github.com/fourtytoo/record-deps.git
 $ lein install
```

## Usage

Put `[record-deps "0.1.1-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of
your project.clj.  You can also add something like `:record-deps-txt
"resources/project_dependencies"` to your project map, if you don't
like the default.

Check that it works

```console
 $ lein record-deps
 $ cat resources/deps.txt
```

Where and what type of file is saved depends on the project map keys
`:record-deps-edn` and `:record-deps-txt`.  The former specifies the
pathname of the EDN data and the latter the pathname of the textual
description.  Whichever you are more comfortable with.


## Query

If you want to avoid extracting the file from the jar every time you
want to check the dependency tree, you may want to include this code
in your project:

```clojure
(ns resource
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io])
  (:gen-class :main))

(defn -main [& args]
  (doseq [r args]
    (let [r' (io/resource r)]
      (if r'
        (do (println (str "\n>> " r ":"))
            (println (slurp r')))
        (println "Missing" r)))))
```

and then from the command line you can simply

```console
 $ java -cp target/my-program-standalone.jar resource deps.edn
```
